# Cheatsheet

## Design process

- Identify needs
- Develop many alternate solutions
- Prototype
- Evaluate ux.

## Data gathering
- interviews.
- questionnaires.
- observation (direct/indirect).

## Prototyping
- screen sketches.
- storyboard.
- powerpoint.
- lump of wood.

Finds
- Technical issues
- Workflow
- Difficult areas
- Layout design

## Interface evaluation

### Nielsen heuristics

- status visibility.
- Match between system and reality.
- User control and freedom.
- consistency.
- error prevention
- recognition not recall.
- flexibility.
- aesthetic.
- diagnosis of errors.
- help.

## Usability testing

Generally measure stuff like:
- time to complete.
- time to complete with retention (go away and come back).
- Error count.
- Error count per task.
- Success rate.

## Human error

*slip* - error but with correct plan.
*lapse* - error because forgot action.
*mistake* - Mistake in planning.

Types of slips:
- *Capture* # Frequently used action overrides.
- *Data-driven* # unnoticed use of external data interferes.
- *Associative-activation*  # error due to internal thought interferes.

Fixes:
- *slip* - improve ui.
- *mistakes* - provide a better understanding of system.

Keyhole property - show only what's important.

Force function - require uer to confirm their action.

### SRK framework

- *Skill*
    - Automatic, not conscious thought.
- *Rule*
    - Behaviour based on conscious thought and known rules.
- *Knowledge*
    - Improvisation without rules, requires thought and effort and analysis of system state.

Automation handles Skill and Rule sections. Although humans are bad knowledge
behaviours.

### Latent Errors
Errors due to design failures

### Reduce opportunity for error
- Provide good conceptual model
- Desig nto match human limits
    - Working memory
    - problem solving activities


### Feedback

Should provide user feedback on if their input has been received. Either before
or after the action.
