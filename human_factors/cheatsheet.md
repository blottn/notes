Concerned *design*, *evaluation* and *implementation* of interactive computer
systems.

- Useful
    - System achieves functionality
- Usable
    - Should be easy and natural to use
- Used
    - People want to use it (pretty)

### Involved disciplines
- Graphic design
- Ergonomics
- Engineering
- Psychology
- Information systems
- etcetc

> To average user the interface is the system.

### Usable
- Effective
- Efficient
- Safe
- Utility
- Learnable
- Memorisable

#### Fitts List

##### Humans better
- Inductive reasoning.
- Pattern perception.
- Improvisation and flexible procedures.
- Excercise judgement.

##### Machines better
- Quick response
- Repetitive tasks
- Multitasking
- Store information for only a brief time then erase it.

#### Sheridans level of automation

levels 1 -> 10 

1: Computer offers no assistance.
3: Computer narrows selection down.
5: Computer executes with approval.
7: Computer does and informs humans.
10: Computer acts without human.

automation increases system error.


## User Capabilities

- `Attention`
    - layout is important to grab attention.
    - no distractions.
- `Perception`
    - Legibility.
    - Distinguishable icons.
    - Bordering better than contrasting colors.
    - law of Gestalt
        - Proximity (Grouped on nearness of respective parts).
        - Similarity (Groued on similarity).
        - Continuation (Straight lines continue).
        - Closure (Completed items together).
        - Membership (Context matters for sub item).
    - Audio is important
- `Memory`
    - Encoding then retrieving knowledge.
    - More processing knowledge and relating increases retainability.
    - Attention brings to short term, rehearsal -> long term.
    - Information decays out of long term storage.
    - 
- `Learning`
- `Communication verbally`
- `Planning/ problem solving`
